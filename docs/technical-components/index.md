## Component Interactions

The Kled.io Ecosystem components interact with each other to provide a seamless experience for users. Here's how the components work together:

### CLI to Gateway Interaction

The CLI communicates with the Gateway System to execute commands and retrieve information:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant CLI
    participant Gateway
    participant Backend

    User->>CLI: Execute command
    CLI->>Gateway: Send request
    Gateway->>Backend: Process request
    Backend->>Gateway: Return result
    Gateway->>CLI: Return response
    CLI->>User: Display result
```

### Frontend to Backend Interaction

The Flutter UI communicates with the Rust backend through the Rust-to-Flutter Bridge:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Flutter
    participant Bridge

The Kled.io Ecosystem architecture is designed to provide a seamless experience for users, from the command-line interface to the Kled Cluster infrastructure. The architecture is built on several key components, each with its own responsibilities and features.

## Key Components

### [Pure Rust Communication](./pure-rust-communication.md)

The Pure Rust Communication layer provides a high-performance, secure, and reliable communication infrastructure for the Kled.io Ecosystem. Built entirely in Rust, this layer enables efficient data exchange between different components of the system, ensuring optimal performance and security.

Key features:
- High-performance communication using Rust's zero-cost abstractions
- Strong type safety and memory safety guarantees
- Efficient serialization and deserialization of data
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

### [Kled Cluster](./kled-cluster.md)

Kled Clusters are fully operable Kubernetes clusters running inside Physical Clusters, providing a secure and efficient environment for running AI/ML workloads. This architecture enables enterprises to maximize the value of their infrastructure investments while ensuring the security and performance of their AI/ML applications.

Key features:
- Resource efficiency through shared infrastructure
- Strong isolation between workloads
- Seamless scaling for changing requirements
- Advanced user management and administration
- Support for both external and internal clustering

## [Advanced Workspace Technology](./workspace-technology.md)

The Kled.io Ecosystem features an advanced workspace technology that provides a comprehensive environment for development and deployment. This technology is built on DevPod and Daytona, with a proprietary preload for loading Kled into workspaces, creating a powerful and flexible development environment.

Key features:
- Proprietary workspace creation to copy repo's and open in IDE
- Proprietary preload with full language support and Docker/Kubernetes tools
- Multiple workspace providers (local, Kubernetes, cloud)
- Monorepo support with project discovery and dependency management
- Linux-like environment with comprehensive development tools

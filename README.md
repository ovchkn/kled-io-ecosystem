# Kled.io Ecosystem Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the Kled.io Ecosystem, including its architecture, technical components, and features.

## Overview

The Kled.io Ecosystem Documentation provides comprehensive information about the Kled.io Ecosystem, including:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for Docusaurus)
- Python 3 (for serving the static site)

### Building the Documentation

To build the documentation, run the following command:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and build the Docusaurus site.

### Generating a Static HTML Site

If you encounter issues with Docusaurus, you can generate a static HTML site using the following command:

```bash
./generate-static-site.sh
```

This will create a `build` directory containing the static HTML site.

### Serving the Documentation

To serve the documentation locally, run the following command:

```bash
./serve.sh
```

This will start a development server at http://localhost:3000.

### Serving the Static HTML Site

To serve the static HTML site locally, run the following command:

```bash
./serve-static.sh
```

This will start a Python HTTP server at http://localhost:8000.
